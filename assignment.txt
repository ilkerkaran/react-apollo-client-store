As part of our interview process we’d like you to do an exercise for us in React and TypeScript. As a guide aim to do this within 2 hours.

Once submitted, we’ll review the test and if successful, we will invite you to a second interview (remote via zoom) to discuss the test in more detail.

Please use any tools you feel are relevant for JS/React as we’d like to see a production-ready app (styling not important but would be nice to see some CSS/Material) – something simple but something that is ready to go live. Here are the requirements:

·         Create a form component with a single text input and a submit button.

·         The text input should have a default value passed down from another (parent) component.

·         The value from the text input should be rendered under the input as plain text.

·         The plain text should only be updated when the form is submitted.

·         If the value of the input changes, then the border of the input should change colour.

·         Store the value of the text input in an Apollo Client Cache and use it as your state management.

·         Optional: add another field of different type and apply the above
